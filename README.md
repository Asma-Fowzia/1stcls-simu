# Simulation Problem Solving
# Simulation
Simulation enables experimentation on a valid digital representation of a system. Unlike physical modeling, such as making a scale copy of a building, simulation modeling is computer based and uses algorithms and equations.
# Interarrival time
It is a time elapse between the arrival of the object or person and one following it in the queue.
# Arrival Time
The time at which a public conveyance is scheduled to arrive at a given destination.


Here this code is about to find arrival time from customer number and interarrival time.Here i used for loop to implement the code . I took the value of customer no and interarrival time in console and it gave the arrival time.This is C language code.
